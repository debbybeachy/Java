Hi my name is Debby Beachy, the owner and author of Top House Java. Thank you for stopping by for a visit!
    </p>
    
    <p>My journey began back in 2000 when I first came online like millions of others to search for a new career path, to 
be a part of something bigger than myself. I wanted connection,to meet people from around the world.  I felt 
I was missing out on something. 
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
     <h3>Entrepreneurism</h3>
     <p>
Most of my professional life I’ve been an entrepreneur. I’ve had two successful small businesses both in the 
service industry. Working for myself (not by myself) comes so natural for me. Just about this time the blogging 
world was BOOMING. It seem like everyone was into blogging, and so naturally I had to learn everything I
could on the topicI took many online classes. I learned SEO (Search Engine Optimization), social 
media, web-copy,video marketing, personal branding, affiliate marketing, and list building. Which 
lead me too...</p>


     <h3>The Love of code</h3> 
     <p>
I struggled with WordPress themes because I couldn’t get the theme to look the way I wanted it to look.
 I learned with a little bit of code I could change colors, links, pictures, fonts, positioning, etc.  It seemed 
like I was always in the back-end pocking around with the code which would completely 
and inevitably blow up my blog! </p>
      
   <p>
I soon learned I was far more interested with what made the blog work, and the design than 
blogging. Without going through all the online classes, I would have never known this passion for 
design and code which was resting within waiting to be discovered.</p>
     
     
     <p>
     <h3>Could I hack it...?</h3>
     <p>
I signed up for a credit class at our local technical collage called, Web Principles…wow was this a 
challenge. The instructor told the class that there was a waiting list as we had 25 computers and 28 
people signed up. She said, “a few of us would drop out within a couple of classes, and by mid-way 
through half the class would be gone.” Yup that’s right… half the class wouldn’t be able to hack it. 
When she said this she looked right at me, I know I was pegged to be one of the first few to drop 
out. You know the end of the story.  I was one out of four that received the “A” in the end!</p>
       
   <p>In truth, it’s really the beggining of an amazing journey of creativity, knowledge, challenges, and 
discipline.</p>
